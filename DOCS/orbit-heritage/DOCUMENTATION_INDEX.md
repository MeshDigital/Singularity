# ORBIT — Documentation Index

This index was rewritten on 2026-08-10 after removing ~350 files of stale, auto-generated
process documentation (see [DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md](DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md) for what was
removed and why). Every link below was verified to point at a file that actually exists.

## Planning / investigation notes (historical, not guaranteed current)

These are point-in-time working notes from past feature passes — useful for *why* a design
decision was made, not a live reference. Treat anything here as possibly superseded by
[RECENT_CHANGES.md](RECENT_CHANGES.md) or the code itself.

**Note on `.agent/` and `agent/`:** these directories hold scaffolding for a phase-based
autonomous development loop (checkpoints, driver workflows, phase memory). They're
process/tooling state, not user- or developer-facing documentation, and are intentionally
not indexed here.
