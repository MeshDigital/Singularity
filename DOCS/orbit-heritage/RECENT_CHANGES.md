## [0.9.3-alpha] — 2026-10-01

### 🎚️ Auto-mix no longer rushes through tracks
In mix mode, tracks often played for only about a minute before the next one came in. The mix log showed three causes:
- **Drop Sync was the automatic choice.** It leaves the outgoing track 16 bars before its *second* drop, which cuts the rest of the track.
  - Auto now picks **Rolling**: the incoming drop lands as the outgoing track's main section ends, about 32 bars after its last drop.
  - Drop Sync is still available as a preset in the Mix editor.
- **Duplicate drops.** A hand-set "Drop 1" plus an auto "[DROP 1] ✓AI" two seconds later were read as Drop 1 and Drop 2. Drops within 16 bars of each other now count as one, and your own drop wins.
- **Broken analysis.** A 4-minute track stored as 3 s was mixed out at 0.7 s. Tracks with an implausible length (under 30 s, or cues past the end) no longer get a structure plan. The old cue fallback can't cut a track before half way either.

On top of that, automatic mixes never start before **half the outgoing track has played**.

### 📋 Playlist view: more tracks on screen
- **Collapsing header:** scrolling down shrinks the playlist header to a slim bar with ▶, shuffle, name, track count and Discover. Scrolling back to the top restores the full header.
- **One-line toolbar:** search, status chips, Filters, Text, ＋ Queue (N), Mix and Columns (⚙) share one row instead of three. The track count is in the search placeholder.
- **Columns fit the space.** Hidden columns no longer keep their width. When the list is narrow, for example with the context panel open, the least important columns step aside in this order: Forensics, Rating, Duration, Format, Energy. They used to be cut off under the panel.
- **Resizable context panel:** drag its left edge (300 px up to about half the window). The width is remembered; the default is now 400 instead of 450.

### ✨ Discover: queued suggestions download first
- **First in line:** a queued suggestion (or Top 10) is downloaded before anything else and shows at the top of the Download Center queue.
- **Clickable popup:** the "Queued for download — first in line" popup opens the Download Center when clicked.
- **Bump to top fix:** Bump to top didn't actually win against tracks from higher-tier playlists. It now goes first regardless of playlist.

## [0.9.2-alpha] — 2026-09-30

### ◆ One-click drops, with the rest automatic
Placing a drop used to take several steps, and ORBIT's auto cues stayed on the waveform next to yours. Now one action places the drop and everything around it, in both Cue Forge and the Flow Builder cue editor.

- **Ways to place a drop:**
  - **◆ Drop**, or key **D**. In the Flow Builder this uses where you're listening; in Cue Forge, the playhead.
  - Right-click the waveform → **◆ Drop here**.
  - Keys **1** / **2** force Drop 1 / Drop 2.
  - Setting a cue's role to Drop does the same.
- **What happens automatically:**
  - **Snap:** the drop lands on a bar line (a phrase line with Phrase snapping).
  - **Numbering:** by position. The earlier drop is Drop 1 and the later one Drop 2. A drop placed within 8 bars of an existing one moves that drop.
  - **Build-in cues** before the drop, from the cue template.
  - **Standard pads, names and colours**, so CDJ and controller displays show phrase context:

    | Pads | Cues | Colours |
    |---|---|---|
    | A B C | [IN -16] [IN -8] [DROP 1] | orange / red-orange |
    | D E F | [IN -16] [IN -8] [DROP 2] | purple / cyan |
    | G | [OUT], 32 bars after the last drop, at least 16 bars before the end | red |
    | H | free for loops | |

  - **Auto cues removed:** the analysis' own cues leave the waveform, and the track once saved. The same happens when you add a cue or move an auto cue. Undo brings them back.
- **Linked cues:**
  - Dragging or nudging a drop moves its build-in cues along.
  - A build-in cue you moved or renamed yourself is unlinked and stays put.
  - [OUT] follows the last drop until you move it.
  - Deleting a drop removes its build-in cues.

### 🎚️ Cue templates
One setting, **Cue template**, in both editors. It is used for drops you place and for automatic cue generation.
- **DnB / Bass:** −16 −8. Also used for hardstyle and techno.
- **Long Blend / House:** −32 −16. For house, tech house and trance.
- **Quick Mix / Hip-Hop:** −8 −4. For hip-hop, pop and R&B.
- **Custom:** type the bars, e.g. `32,16,8`.
- **Off:** no build-in cues.
- **Auto:** picks one of the above from the track's genre. The editor shows which one it picked.

The old "Drop countdown" setting carries over; values like `16,8` become Custom.

### 🤖 Automatic cues use the same layout
- Generated cues now use the template, the [IN]/[DROP]/[OUT] names and the pad layout above.
- [OUT] is the detected outro when it leaves 16 bars to mix out. Otherwise it is 32 bars after the last drop, the same point the mix planner mixes out from.
- Background re-analysis no longer adds auto cues back to a track where you have placed drops yourself. **Regenerate Cues** still does, when you ask for it.
- Existing cues named "Drop 1" or "16 Bars to Drop 1" are still recognised.

## [0.9.1-alpha] — 2026-09-29

### 🎚️ Mixes planned from the music's structure
Auto transitions used to start at a single "Outro" cue. Auto-analysis places that cue 0–21 s before the end, which leaves no room for an 8–16-bar blend.
- **Intro and outro sections (Mixxx style):**
  - The intro runs from the first downbeat to Drop 1.
  - The outro starts 32 bars after the last drop and ends at the last audible second.
  - A transition fits inside both sections.
- **Whole phrases:** every transition is 8, 16 or 32 bars and starts on a bar line.
- **Three DnB transition types**, chosen from energy, key compatibility and tempo:
  - **Rolling:** the incoming drop lands exactly as the outgoing track's main section ends.
  - **Drop Sync:** both drops land together.
  - **Relaxed:** outro into intro.
  - Rolling and Drop Sync swap the bassline in one step, on the drop.
- **Vocal clashes avoided:** when two vocals would overlap, the planner picks another transition type.
- **Tempo matching:** the incoming track is sped up or slowed to the outgoing track's tempo, up to 6%. Half-time and double-time readings count as the same tempo.
- **Tighter mix start:** the start of the mix no longer drifts up to 50 ms late.
- **Mix editor:** it shows the same plan real playback uses. Choosing Rolling, Relaxed or Drop Sync moves the mix points to where that transition belongs, and 32 bars is a new length option.

### 🤖 CUE-DETR cue detection, to compare for yourself
- CUE-DETR (ETH DISCO, MIT licence) now runs inside ORBIT. It is a vision model that looks at a spectrogram and marks where a DJ would put cues.
- The port is checked against the original Python code and produces identical cues on a real track. The model adds about 167 MB to the installer.
- **Regenerate Cues** is now a submenu, in the library's right-click menu and in the Flow Builder cue strip:
  - **ORBIT analysis:** ORBIT's normal cues.
  - **ORBIT + CUE-DETR (compare):** ORBIT's cues, with **✓AI** added where the model agrees. The model's other points are added as cyan **AI** cues.
  - **CUE-DETR only:** just the model's points.
- It takes about 10–13 s per track the first time. Results are saved, so switching modes afterwards is instant.
- Measured on 68 tracks of hand-placed DJ cues:
  - ORBIT's own cues beat CUE-DETR on its own: 30% vs 23% within a bar. Snapping the model's points to the bar or phrase grid doesn't help.
  - When the two agree, the cue matched a DJ cue 52% of the time, against 23% for the rest. The compare mode shows exactly that.

### ◆ Simpler drops in the Flow Builder
- **◆ Drop here** in the transition editor's cue strip: click the waveform on the drop, then click this. It places the Drop and its countdown cues in one step.
- **Your drop clears the auto cues:** when you set a drop yourself, or move an auto-detected one, the other auto-generated cues are cleared so the waveform stays readable. This works in Cue Forge too, and undo brings them back.
- **Mix points follow:** after you save or regenerate a deck's cues, the transition is re-planned from them.

### 🏷️ Serato cue tags
- **Write Cues to Serato Tags** in the library's right-click menu. It writes your cues into the audio file as Serato Markers2, the tag Serato DJ and Mixxx read. This works for MP3, FLAC, AIFF, WAV, Ogg and Opus.
  - **Keep Serato's** adds ORBIT's cues in free slots and leaves cues you set in Serato alone.
  - **Replace** swaps them out, after a confirmation.
  - Track colour, BPM lock and flips are always kept.
- Serato's cue import could never read real Serato cues (it assumed a different binary layout). It now uses the same parser as the export.

### 🔊 Playback fixes
- **Volume:** it jumped to 100% at each track change. ORBIT was setting the Windows master volume of the output device; it now only changes its own level.
- **Output device:** choosing a device in Settings now works, and switches live. If a device is unavailable, ORBIT falls back to the Windows default.
- **Tracks Windows can't decode:** about 3.5% of one test library, some FLAC/Opus/Ogg files, showed no waveform or simply stopped. They are now decoded once with ffmpeg and cached.
- **Mix queues:**
  - A mix no longer stops when it reaches a missing file; missing files are skipped.
  - Transitions are set up for tracks further down the list, not just the first 50.
  - A track that ended mid-crossfade no longer stalls the next one.

### 🛠 Other
- AI cue labels always use a dot for decimals (for example "AI 0.93"), because labels go into Rekordbox and Serato exports.
- Fixed a random test failure. A test left ReactiveUI pointing at a scheduler it had disposed, and later tests tripped over it depending on run order.
- **Cue benchmark:** `Tests/CueBenchmark --cue-detr <cache.json>` scores CUE-DETR against the reference cues.

## [0.9.0-alpha] — 2026-09-29

### 🎯 Beat grids that match the music
ORBIT's grid was no better than chance against a DJ's Rekordbox cues (52% of hand cues on a beat, 14% on a bar line). Stored BPMs were whole-number histogram bins, and DnB half-time readings were rounded before doubling, so a real 174 BPM track was stored as 178.
- `BeatGridFitter` fits tempo and phase to the beat tracker's ticks (a consensus search, then least squares on the ticks that agree) and picks the downbeat from sub-bass returns and dropouts.
- `BpmDetectionService` keeps Essentia's exact BPM instead of the rounded histogram value.
- Rekordbox's own PQTZ beat grid is adopted when ORBIT's ticks line up with it.
- A one-time background pass re-fitted the library, with a database backup first: 3,528 tracks updated, 538 of them from Rekordbox's grid.
- Measured on hand cues: on-beat 52% → 92%, on-bar 14% → 77%, BPM within 0.1 of Rekordbox 5% → 86–91%.

### 🎛️ Flow Builder becomes a mix & cue workspace
- Edit cues in place in the transition editor: drag with snapping, add, rename, role, pad, colour, loop, nudge, undo, "use as mix point". Edits auto-save.
- Previous / Next transition and a mini strip of the set.
- Playlist Play starts at the selected track; with Mix on, Play Track continues the mix from that track.

### ✨ Playlist Discover
- New **Discover** sidepanel tab, opened from a playlist's header. It suggests tracks to add from Beatport (new releases by the playlist's artists, the genre top 100) and Deezer (related artists).
- Suggestions are ranked by BPM, key and genre fit. Tracks you already own are hidden. When Beatport and Deezer both suggest a track, it gets a ★ and a ranking boost. The best Deezer-only finds are looked up on Beatport to fill in BPM, key and genre.
- Actions per suggestion: preview clip; **Queue** (adds it to the playlist as a missing track and starts the Soulseek download); a Soulseek search; open on Beatport to buy. **Top 10** queues the best ten.
- Beatport's public pages sit behind Cloudflare, which blocks .NET's HTTP client, so they are fetched with Windows' built-in curl.exe. Beatport and Deezer can each be switched off in the panel.
- Suggestions are saved per playlist and show instantly, even after a restart; anything downloaded or queued since is removed. They are re-evaluated in the background only when the playlist changed a lot (about 20% of tracks, or 10+) or after 14 days. Hidden (✕) suggestions stay hidden.
- "Already owned" covers the library and every playlist (including queued and missing tracks) and handles the library's naming styles: "Title - Original Mix", joint "A & B" credits, "(SOTA Extended Mix)" = "(SOTA Remix)". Checked against the real library.

### 🎆 Fullscreen player and visualizer
- The fullscreen player is rebuilt: full-screen visualizer, large artwork with BPM / key / energy, track position in the queue, and a MIXING indicator during crossfades.
- **Up Next** column shows the whole queue with the playing track highlighted and played tracks dimmed; it scrolls to the current track. The sidepanel and Now Playing queues mark the playing track too.
- Visualizer: runs at display frame rate, bass-to-treble log bands with auto-gain and peak caps, a real oscilloscope and phase scope, and correct colours (they were near-black). Fixed per-frame native memory leaks and render-thread races. The spectrum is now computed from a mono mix; it used to FFT interleaved stereo, which scrambled every visualizer.
- Seek bar works while dragging; controls fade when the mouse is idle; borderless fullscreen (⛶ / F); keyboard: Space, ← →, Shift+← →, ↑ ↓, M, V, Q, Esc.

### ▶ Always-visible playback controls
- Previous / Play-Pause / Next and the current track sit in the top bar on every page, with a button for the fullscreen player. In Zen mode a floating play/pause button stays on screen.

### ⏱ Drop countdowns and fine-tuning by ear
- Setting or moving a Drop places 32/16/8-bar countdown cues before it. Auto picks by genre; configurable or off.
- Arrow keys fine-tune the selected cue (beat / Shift bar / Ctrl 10 ms) and replay from it on every press. A playing mix waits until the cues are saved.

### 🛠 Fixes
- About 12 warning and error toasts that never appeared now show.
- Download Center "Find Similar" works, and "Search Again" really searches again.
- Settings Save confirms, and failed saves are reported.
- Second-drop detection now follows the breakdown after Drop 1.
- The aggressive-mood signal is no longer always zero.
- Removed an unbound delete-without-confirmation command and an unused silent mock-stem service.
- Fixed a startup crash from a cue-strip binding.
- Removed EDMFormer, the optional Python phrase-detection service. It was never installed, and Rekordbox phrase data plus the built-in analysis already cover its job. The Settings "AI Engine" card and install scripts are gone.
- Found and fixed the real cause of the random test-suite failures: a test replaced the app-wide ReactiveUI scheduler and disposed it without restoring the original.
- **FLAC seeking:** clicking a waveform in the Mix editor always played FLAC tracks from the start, and Mix transitions started incoming FLAC tracks at 0:00 instead of their mix-in point. Windows Media Foundation drops a seek made before the first read and lands up to ~0.9 s off after. Seeks on FLAC/M4A are now sample-exact (preview, Mix preload, Now Playing, Cue Forge).
- **Soulseek sharing:** the server was told you share 5 folders (the number of share roots) — leech-detection scripts read that as a tiny share. It now reports the real counts (e.g. 115 folders / 3,403 files) and updates them when the share changes. Only music files are shared (in-progress `.part` / `.incomplete` downloads were shared before), and peers see short folder names instead of full Windows paths.
- Tests now use their own throwaway database; some used to write to the real library, which left test folders shared on Soulseek.

### 📋 Open work
All open items now live in `DOCS/OPEN_WORK_PLAN_2026-09-27.md`. Stale plan files moved to `DOCS/archive/plans/`.

## [0.7.1-beta] — 2026-08-04

### 🧠 Real genre/mood/embedding AI — replacing a silently-dead Essentia layer

ORBIT's bundled `essentia_streaming_extractor_music.exe` was confirmed (via repeated empirical testing, including a re-verification via native PowerShell after an initial Git-Bash test was correctly challenged for possible path mistranslation) to silently produce an *empty* `highlevel` JSON section regardless of `profile.yaml`'s `tensorflow_models` directive. Genre classification, mood scoring, and similarity embeddings had been dead for every track in the library — not erroring, just quietly producing nothing.

Rather than trying to fix or replace the Essentia binary, or standing up a Python microservice (a dependency shape that's repeatedly gone unset-up in this codebase — see EDMFormer), genre/mood/embeddings are now computed directly in C# via ONNX Runtime, in-process, using the same DirectML execution provider the existing stem-separation feature already relies on:

- `Engine/Analysis/EffnetMelSpectrogramExtractor.cs` — mel-spectrogram preprocessing (16 kHz, 512/256 frame/hop, 96 Slaney-scale bands, log(10000·x+1) compression) matching Essentia's own `TensorflowInputMusiCNN` convention, cross-verified against three independent sources.
- `Services/Similarity/DiscogsEffnetEmbeddingExtractor.cs` — the shared 1280-D DiscogsEffnet embedding (corrected from an earlier incorrect 2048-D assumption; real input/output tensor names differ from the published JSON metadata and were confirmed against the loaded model's own `InputMetadata`/`OutputMetadata`).
- `Services/Similarity/EffnetClassifierHeadService.cs` — MTG-Jamendo 87-class genre + 5 independent binary mood classifiers (Happy/Sad/Relaxed/Party/Aggressive), chained off the shared embedding.
- Fed into the existing `AudioAnalysisService.InferAndApplyGenreAsync` multi-source fusion scorer as a new highest-weighted candidate (0.85) rather than replacing that mechanism — a future working Essentia binary would just add a second corroborating vote.
- Validated against a real known-genre track (top prediction matched) before wiring into production — mel-spectrogram preprocessing has no unit-testable ground truth of its own, so this empirical check was the actual gate.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Real-Time Genre, Mood & Embeddings" section for the full data-flow diagram.

### 🎨 Track Inspector — surfaces the new AI data, no pill badges

The Analysis tab's "Vibe" section (a `VibePillContainer` of colored pill badges) is replaced with a "GENRE & MOOD" section using the panel's existing bar/percentage visual language instead:

- Ranked AI genre classification as confidence bars (top 3), falling back to a plain label for tracks analyzed before this pipeline existed.
- The full 5-way mood breakdown (Party/Aggressive/Happy/Relaxed/Sad) as individual bars — previously only a single winner-takes-all mood pill was shown; the other 4 scores were computed and silently discarded.
- Sonic Profile's Arousal/Valence bars (never backed by real data — the emomusic model this would need was never built) are removed rather than shown at a permanent 0%.
- The Deep Analysis radar chart's two dead Arousal/Valence points are swapped for Party/Aggressive, so all 5 axes now carry real data.
- Required 4 new `AudioFeaturesEntity` columns (schema migration #23) to persist the 4 mood scores that were previously computed then thrown away — `Sadness` already existed and covers the 5th.

### 🔧 Fixed: analysis results not appearing until app restart

`AnalysisQueueService` published `TrackAnalysisUpdatedEvent` on every successful analysis, but nothing in the codebase ever subscribed to it — `VirtualizedTrackCollection` wired up the started/failed bookends (`TrackAnalysisStartedEvent`/`TrackAnalysisFailedEvent`) but the success case was apparently never finished. Re-analyzing an already-open track updated the database correctly but the visible Inspector kept showing stale data until the track was reselected after a full app reload. Fixed by subscribing the dead event to the existing full-refetch-from-DB refresh path — BPM, key, energy, danceability, and genre now confirmed to update live; one narrower residual gap (the new mood-breakdown bars specifically not always picking up the live refresh, though always correct on reload) is still open.

### 🧹 "ID" placeholder tracks — cleanup tool + confirmed the import fix already covers it

DJ-tracklist shorthand for an unidentified track (e.g. "Basstripper - ID") was previously kept as a real, downloadable track. A parser-level fix already existed (`Utils/CommentTracklistParser.cs`, 2026-07-31) and was confirmed still correct across every current import path — the pollution found in the library was legacy data from imports at or before that fix, never retroactively cleaned. Added `Services/UnidentifiedTrackCleanupService.cs`, wired into **Library → Tools → "Remove Unidentified ('ID') Tracks"**: finds every track titled "ID" across playlists and the library, deletes the (very likely wrongly-matched) file from disk, and removes all associated rows including cached analysis data, behind a confirmation dialog since it's irreversible. Removed 18 unidentified tracks / 7 wrongly-downloaded files / 22 playlist rows on first run against the live library.

### 🩺 Corruption scanning — fewer false positives, much faster, self-healing

- `AudioIngestionPipeline.ProbeForCorruptionAsync`'s FFmpeg decode probe now runs single-threaded (`-threads 1`) — FFmpeg's default multi-threaded decode made error counts non-deterministic near a bad frame, observed directly on real files that logged decode errors on one scan and none on the next.
- `AudioCorruptionScannerService` now distinguishes an isolated, recovered decode glitch (a handful of error lines — common in P2P-sourced files, barely dents a multi-minute track's analysis) from pervasive corruption (errors repeating throughout) via an error-line-count threshold, rather than treating any decode error at all as fully Fatal. Previously this blocked real, largely-intact tracks from ever being analyzed over a single recovered glitch.
- `LibraryCorruptionScanService` now scans in bounded parallel (`Parallel.ForEachAsync`, half the CPU core count) instead of a fully serial loop — a multi-thousand-track library previously took a linear chain of external FFmpeg process spawns, tens of minutes to hours.
- `AnalysisPageViewModel` now auto-remediates Fatal issues immediately after a scan completes (no manual "Fix" click required) and subscribes to `LibraryEntryDeletedEvent` so a track removed elsewhere (e.g. by remediation) disappears from the page immediately instead of leaving its last-loaded waveform/BPM on screen looking current. The Analysis page also now tells corrupt-file failures apart from generic ones ("file may be corrupt — try re-downloading" vs "analysis failed: ...") since retrying a corrupt file fails identically every time.

#### ✅ Verification

- `dotnet build` clean, full `dotnet test` suite green (aside from the pre-existing, timing-sensitive `BackgroundJobQueueTests` flake under parallel load, confirmed clean in isolation, unrelated to this batch).
- ONNX pipeline live-tested end-to-end in the running app (not just a standalone harness): triggered analysis on a real track via the UI, confirmed via direct SQLite query that all 5 mood scores and the genre distribution landed correctly, and confirmed the Track Inspector renders them.
- ID-track cleanup run live against the actual library and independently re-verified via SQLite query afterward (zero "ID" rows remain anywhere).

## [0.7.0-beta] — 2026-08-03

### 🎯 Drop/Cue Auto-Generation — real signal routing fix

Cue Forge's "Auto-Generate" placed the Drop cue at a generic, inaccurate position regardless of genre. Root cause: two unrelated classes were both named `CueGenerationService` — a weak one (`Services/CueGenerationService.cs`, plain RMS-derivative heuristic, no sub-bass/spectral-flux awareness) driving the automatic background pipeline, and a strong one (`Engine/Cueing/CueGenerationService.cs`, real 3-path priority: EDMFormer ML → sub-bass/spectral-flux DSP signals → heuristic fallback) that Cue Forge's manual button called. The automatic pipeline bridged its weak per-track sections into `AudioFeaturesEntity.PhraseSegmentsJson` — the same field meant only for genuine EDMFormer ML output — so the strong engine's ML-priority path almost always fired using that laundered weak data instead of ever reaching the real DSP signals, which were being computed and stored every analysis but never used.

- Added `AudioFeaturesEntity.PhraseSegmentsSource` ("EDMFormer" vs "Heuristic") so cue generation's signal-priority gate can tell genuine ML phrase data from the rule-based bridge.
- Promoted the features→analysis-result bridge into a shared `Engine/Analysis/AnalysisPipelineResultBuilder`, used by both the manual Auto-Generate button and the automatic background pipeline.
- The automatic pipeline (`AnalyzeTrackStructureJob`) now generates cues through the strong `Engine.Cueing.CueGenerationService` instead of the weak one, which — along with its redundant call from `CuePointDetectionService` — has been deleted as dead code.
- `GenerateCuesDsp` gained a broadband RMS energy-jump drop candidate (for continuous-bassline genres like techno/tech-house where sub-bass never truly drops out) and genre-aware signal weighting; Build/Breakdown cues are now derived as consistent bar-math offsets from the confirmed drop by default, only overridden when a real detected boundary lands close to that expected position.
- `PhraseAlignmentService` gained dedicated `House` and `Techno` genre bar-templates (previously any "techno"-flavoured genre string collapsed into the `MelodicTechno` template, and "House" silently fell back to the generic `EDM` template).

Already-analyzed tracks benefit immediately from re-running Auto-Generate (the sub-bass/novelty signals were already stored); new analyses pick up the fix automatically.

#### ✅ Verification

- `dotnet build` clean, `dotnet test` full suite green (aside from a pre-existing, timing-sensitive `BackgroundJobQueueTests` flake under parallel load, confirmed clean in isolation).
- New/updated targeted coverage: `Tests/SLSKDONET.Tests/Engine/CueGenerationServiceTests.cs`, `Tests/SLSKDONET.Tests/ViewModels/CueForgeAnalysisResultBuilderTests.cs`.

### 🔊 Playback: WASAPI/ASIO output selection + loudness normalization

- `AppConfig`/`ConfigManager` gained persisted `AudioOutputMode`/`AudioOutputDeviceName` (WaveOut / WasapiShared / WasapiExclusive / Asio) and `LoudnessNormalizationEnabled`/`LoudnessNormalizationTargetLufs` (defaults to -14 LUFS, matching Spotify/YouTube's streaming target), wired through `Services/Audio/AudioOutputProvider.cs` and `AudioPlayerService`.

### 💬 Users & Contacts — chat-first profile redesign

- The profile pane now shows chat as the primary surface instead of a buried 4th tab; Overview/Browse Shares/Download History moved into an on-demand slide-out Info drawer.
- `MessageThreadView` gained real virtualization, avatars with deterministic initials/colors, message grouping with date separators, auto-scroll with a "new messages" indicator, a "load earlier messages" pagination row, and Enter-to-send.
- Fixed a presence-watch ref-count leak on rapid profile switching (`UserProfileViewModel`/`UserPresenceWatchService`).

### 🗑️ Library: Remove Track dialog + unidentified-track guard

- Right-click "Remove Track" now asks whether to remove from the current playlist only or delete from disk/library entirely, instead of a single ambiguous destructive action.
- Fixed the removed track not disappearing from the visible list immediately (`TrackListViewModel` wasn't refreshing on `ProjectUpdatedEvent`).
- Tracks titled "ID" (unidentified, DJ-tracklist convention) are now blocked from being added to any playlist at the shared `LibraryService.AddTracksToProjectAsync` chokepoint.

### 🎨 Sidebar player visualizer restored

- Root-caused and fixed a render-thread crash (`ICustomDrawOperation.Render` reading Avalonia `StyledProperty` getters off the UI thread throws with no trace anywhere) that had silently broken the sidebar visualizer; re-added it with a preset-cycle control.

### 🔔 Notifications & downloads

- Added real OS-level Windows Action Center toasts (`WindowsToastService`) for peer chat, independent of the in-app-only notification popup.
- Added narrow, safety-gated auto-solving of Soulseek peer "reply with this word to unlock downloads" gate-bot challenges (`PeerVerificationChallengeService`), off any general-purpose auto-responder behavior — only fires for peers with a recent actual download attempt, at most once per peer per session.
- Added an `[AutoDownload]` strict-mode config block (format/bitrate/match-score/duration-tolerance thresholds, excluded-phrase filtering) for stricter automatic download acceptance.

#### ✅ Verification

- Full solution build clean; full test suite green aside from the known `BackgroundJobQueueTests` flake noted above.

### 🧩 Library Sidebar Unification Reopened (Slice 1)

Execution for the previously parked library sidebar unification plan has now started.

- Extracted the inline Playlist Intelligence block from `LibraryPage.axaml` into a dedicated reusable control: `Views/Avalonia/Controls/PlaylistIntelligencePanel.axaml`.
- Rewired `LibraryPage.axaml` to host `PlaylistIntelligencePanel` for intelligence-mode rendering, reducing inline view complexity and establishing the first migration seam.
- Added desktop global-inspector template coverage for `LibraryViewModel` in `MainWindow.axaml` so double-inspector context is consistently renderable across shell variants.
- Added architecture guard tests (`LibrarySidebarUnificationStartTests`) to lock this extraction and prevent accidental regression back to large inline intelligence markup.

#### ✅ Verification

- `LibrarySidebarUnificationStartTests`: added and passing.
- Existing focused Frequent Sources gate remains green after this UI extraction pass.

### 📦 Frequent Sources Activation (Phase 1 Ongoing)

This pass moved Frequent Sources from draft scaffolding into active implementation while preserving local-only privacy constraints.

- Added production Settings UX for Frequent Sources staging path management, including browse action wiring in SettingsViewModel/SettingsPage.
- Activated the Soulseek transfer-completion hook to upsert local frequent source stats through FrequentSourceService.
- Added remote-folder extraction helper for transfer metadata and kept the hook fail-safe (non-fatal if hook processing fails).
- Replaced placeholder FrequentSourceService tests with real SQLite-backed behavior coverage (upsert aggregation, ranking precedence, clear semantics, disabled feature gate).
- Replaced placeholder profile-gated Frequent Sources UI tests with executable SettingsViewModel assertions (feature load-state + browse command path update).
- Added profile-gated adapter-hook regression tests for Frequent Sources path extraction normalization and hook-to-service upsert invocation.
- Added adapter-hook fail-safe tests for null-service no-op and disabled-feature no-write behavior.
- Removed reflection from adapter-hook tests by exposing hook helpers as internal and granting test assembly visibility.
- Added a dedicated download-success call-site helper (`TryRecordFrequentSourceDownloadAsync`) so filename-to-folder extraction + byte fallback logic are directly testable.
- Propagated cancellation token flow from `DownloadAsync` into Frequent Sources hook processing.
- Hardened FrequentSourceService with canonical key normalization (trim/slash/repeated-separator collapse/lowercase) and monotonic last-download timestamp updates.
- Expanded FrequentSourceService behavior coverage for normalization, out-of-order timestamp handling, create-on-missing flag updates, and disabled-feature flag no-ops.

#### ✅ Verification

- `FrequentSourceServiceTests`: 8 succeeded, 0 failed.

### 🧪 Memory Backlog Hardening Follow-up

This pass continued autonomous closure of repository memory items with focused regression coverage and verification.

- Added `DownloadCenterSoftClearContractTests` to lock the soft-clear contract across persistence mapping and VM hydration (`LibraryService` entity↔model mapping + `UnifiedTrackViewModel` constructor hydration).
- Added `LibraryFolderScannerServiceTests` to lock default-folder registration behavior (`EnsureDefaultFolderAsync`) for insert-on-missing, trailing-separator dedupe, and Windows case-insensitive dedupe.
- Added `SectionVectorServiceTests` to lock section-embedding precedence (`SectionEmbeddingJson` first, then deep texture embedding, then vector embedding fallback) for section-aware similarity and bridge quality scoring.
- Re-verified global Soulseek transient-timeout suppression behavior in app-level exception handling (`IsTransientSoulseekError` / `SetObserved` flow) via focused test execution.

#### ✅ Verification

- Enforced duration proximity filtering in strict candidate collection using `AutoDownloadDurationToleranceSeconds`.
- Hardened scoring so wrong formats, suspicious FLAC transcodes, low bitrate candidates, and undersized files fail closed.
- Wired strict-mode post-download verification through `PrefetchVerifier` so failed verification removes the file and marks the track failed.
- Added regression coverage for duration filtering, minimum-score rejection, and strict verification handoff.

#### ✅ Verification

- Targeted strict-download tests passed cleanly: 33 succeeded, 0 failed.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-20

### 🔎 Search-to-Mix Handoff + Theme Resource Cleanup

This follow-up roadmap pass focused on acquisition-to-creation flow and shell consistency.

- Added selection summary feedback in the Search surface so batch staging stays visible while curating candidates.
- Hardened the shell's Acquire navigation state so Import and Import Preview remain clearly anchored in the correct section during workflow transitions.
- Replaced key hardcoded dark panel backgrounds on Import, Search, Workstation, and the tablet shell surface with a shared theme resource brush for more consistent theming and easier future tuning.
- Refreshed the documentation set with a new roadmap-progress and doc-gap audit covering the latest player, workstation, search, and import work.

#### ✅ Verification

- Targeted regressions passed cleanly: 64 succeeded, 0 failed.

### 🎧 DJ Cockpit Workflow Polish — Session Summary

This session focused on turning ORBIT into a more direct, musician-friendly prep and mix cockpit with smarter energy analysis, clearer deck controls, and faster player-to-workstation flow.

#### ⚡ Energy Analysis & Structural Prep

- Added a new energy-analysis pipeline via EnergyAnalysisService so tracks now receive deterministic whole-track and per-section energy scoring.
- Extended AnalyzeTrackStructureJob to persist segmented energy, align structural phrases, and enrich phrase sections for downstream transition and similarity logic.
- Registered the new analysis services in DI and validated the workflow with focused test coverage.

#### 🎛️ Workstation Deck Clarity & Cue Prep

- Replaced cryptic single-letter stem toggles with clear Vocal, Drum, Bass, and Other controls.
- Added section-aware shortcuts for View, Build, Drop, and Outro navigation directly on each deck strip.
- Auto-seeded hot cues from analyzed cue roles and exposed clearer cue-prep summaries, MARK and AUTO actions, and friendlier pad labels.
- Hardened cue loading so cue hydration and reset flows behave deterministically on the UI thread.

#### 🔀 Harmonic Guidance & Transition Readiness

- Added live deck-side mix-readiness summaries, transition status text, and harmonic guidance for safer blends.
- Added semitone shift controls with clearer current-key feedback for quick harmonic correction during prep.
- Improved phrase-aware snapping and transition labeling so blend timing is easier to judge at a glance.

#### ▶️ Player, Inspector, and Queue Workflow Polish

- Upgraded the now-playing sidebar with a current-track context summary and compact DJ badges for tempo, key, energy, cues, and readiness state.
- Added direct actions from the player for Inspector, Workstation, Add to Mix, and Reveal in Explorer.
- Made queue items directly playable and removable from the sidebar for faster auditioning.

#### ✅ Verification

- Focused regressions covering the player and workstation workflow passed cleanly: 18 succeeded, 0 failed.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-10

### 🎛️ Cockpit Workstation — UI Feature Additions (Pure Wiring, Zero Backend Changes)

Four mixing features wired to the already-complete `DeckEngine` backend:

- **Crossfader A↔B** — horizontal slider in the transport bar centre; bound to `WorkstationViewModel.CrossfaderPosition` which wraps `DeckPair.CrossfaderPosition` (equal-power cos/sin law already in engine).
- **Loop beat buttons** — 1 / 2 / 4 / 8-beat + Exit Loop row added to the right zone of the transport bar; `Loop1/2/4/8Command` + `ExitLoopFocusedCommand` in `WorkstationViewModel`.
- **Per-deck pitch fader ±8% + Key Lock** — vertical `Slider` and `KEY` toggle added to each deck strip in `WorkstationDeckRow.axaml`; bound to existing `DeckViewModel.PitchSemitones` and `KeyLockEnabled`.
- **8 hot-cue pad buttons per deck** — CDJ-style coloured pad row below the waveform in `WorkstationDeckRow.axaml`; `HotCue1Command`–`HotCue8Command` in `WorkstationDeckViewModel` call `DeckEngine.JumpToHotCue(slot)`.

---

### 🔍 Cue Point Auto-Analysis Pipeline — DI Registration + Batch Analyze Commands

The full phrase/cue-detection pipeline (`StructuralAnalysisEngine` → `CuePointDetectionService` → `CueGenerationService` → `AnalyzeTrackStructureJob`) existed but was never registered in DI and thus never ran.

**`App.axaml.cs`** — Registered `CueGenerationService`, `CuePointDetectionService`, `AnalyzeTrackStructureJob` as singletons.

**`ViewModels/Workstation/WorkstationViewModel.cs`**:
- `AnalyzePlaylistCuesCommand` — analyzes all tracks in the active playlist; skips any that already have cues via `ICuePointService.GetByTrackIdAsync`.
- `AnalyzeSelectedCuesCommand` — same but scoped to the DataGrid selection; invoked from `OnAnalyzeSelectedClick` code-behind.
- `IsAnalyzing`, `AnalysisProgress`, `AnalysisStatusText` — reactive state for live progress reporting.
- `RunCueAnalysisAsync()` — shared worker: cancels previous run, iterates tracks, skip-guard, calls `AnalyzeTrackStructureJob.ExecuteAsync(hash, ct)`.

**`Views/Avalonia/WorkstationPage.axaml`** — Flow Drawer header now has:
- **⚡ Analyze Playlist** button (green) and **⚡ Selected** button (blue).
- Collapsible progress strip (ProgressBar + status text) visible only while `IsAnalyzing` is true.

---

### 🧩 Section-Aware Playlist Optimisation — SectionVectorService

The `PlaylistOptimizer` previously treated tracks as atomic scalars (BPM + key + global energy). The `TrackPhraseEntity` rows (Intro/Build/Drop/Breakdown/Outro with per-section energy) existed in the DB but were never consumed.

**`Models/SectionFeatureVector.cs`** — Lightweight value type for one structural section: `EnergyLevel`, `StartRatio`, `DurationRatio`, `Arousal`, `Danceability`, `SpectralBrightness`, `Confidence`. Provides `DistanceTo()` (4-D Euclidean) and `TransitionScore()`.

**`Services/Similarity/SectionVectorService.cs`** — Lazy-loading, in-memory cached service:
- `GetSectionsAsync / GetIntroSectionAsync / GetOutroSectionAsync / GetPeakSectionAsync`
- `TransitionCostCached(fromHash, toHash)` — synchronous outro→intro distance for use inside the O(n²) greedy loop
- `PreloadAsync(hashes)` — bulk-warms cache before optimizer pass; `Invalidate` / `InvalidateAll`

**`Services/Playlist/PlaylistOptimizerOptions`** — Added `SectionTransitionWeight = 2.0` (equivalent to ~1 Camelot step penalty; set to 0 to disable).

**`Services/Playlist/PlaylistOptimizer`** — Before the greedy pass, calls `PreloadAsync`; inside the inner loop adds `TransitionCostCached × SectionTransitionWeight` to edge cost. The optimizer now naturally prefers successors whose Intro energy/spectral profile matches the current track's Outro.

**`App.axaml.cs`** — Registered `SectionVectorService` as singleton.

---

### ⚡ Multi-Dimensional Track Compatibility Scoring — Double Drop Detection

The Similar Tracks panel previously showed only a single raw embedding cosine score. There was no way to identify double-drop candidates or understand *why* two tracks matched.

**`Models/TrackMatchScore.cs`** — Composite record with 6 scored dimensions (all 0–1):

| Field | Formula / Source |
|---|---|
| `HarmonyScore` | `1 − CamelotDistance / 6` |
| `BeatScore` | Best BPM ratio across 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:2, 2:3 via `exp(−diff/3)` |
| `SoundScore` | Embedding cosine similarity (2048-D ONNX or 128-D fallback) |
| `DropSonicScore` | Drop section 4-D Euclidean match; falls back to `SoundScore` if no phrase data |
| `DoubleDropScore` | Geometric mean of `Harmony × TightBeat × DropSonic` (±1 BPM tolerance); flags `IsPotentialDoubleDrop` at ≥ 0.75 |
| `OverallScore` | `35% Sound + 25% Harmony + 20% Beat + 20% Drop` |

**`Services/Similarity/TrackMatchScorer.cs`** — Pure static scorer; no DI, no state. Accepts `AudioFeaturesEntity` for both tracks, embedding cosine, and optional `SectionFeatureVector` for each track's Drop section. Exposes `CamelotDistancePublic` wrapper on `PlaylistOptimizer`.

**`ViewModels/SimilarTracksViewModel.cs`** — `QueryAsync` now batch-loads `AudioFeaturesEntity` for seed + all hits in one EF query, preloads section vectors, calls `TrackMatchScorer.Compute` per hit, and passes `TrackMatchScore` to each row VM. `SimilarTrackRowViewModel` extended with `OverallScore`, `HarmonyScore`, `BeatScore`, `DropSonicScore`, `DoubleDropScore`, `HarmonyLabel`, `BeatLabel`, `DropLabel`, `IsPotentialDoubleDrop`.

**`Views/Avalonia/SimilarTracksPanel.axaml`**:
- **⚡ orange badge** on any row where `IsPotentialDoubleDrop` is true.
- **H / B / D mini-scores** below the main Match% (purple=Harmony, blue=Beat, red=Drop).
- **Harmony + Beat text labels**: "Same key", "2× (double time)", "±3.2 BPM", "Drop compatible", "⚡ Double drop ready".

### 🐛 Expanded Player — Crash on Expand Button Fixed

Clicking the **EXPAND** button in the sidebar music player crashed the application without any log output, indicating an `AccessViolationException` from native Skia code — unrecoverable .NET exceptions that bypass all exception handlers.

**Root cause — `LiveBackground.cs` (two related race conditions):**

1. **`ProcessBlur` disposul race**: `ProcessBlur` runs on a `ThreadPool` worker thread. When a new blurred `SKImage` is ready, it called `Interlocked.Exchange(ref _blurredImage, image)` and immediately `old?.Dispose()` on the previous image. However, Avalonia's render thread may simultaneously be inside `LiveBackgroundCustomDrawOperation.Render()` using that exact image pointer — calling `_image.Width` or `DrawImage` on a disposed native `sk_image_t` → `AccessViolationException`.

2. **`UpdateBlurredBitmap` source-null race**: When track playback stops, `UpdateBlurredBitmap(null)` called `_blurredImage?.Dispose()` on the UI thread while the render thread could be mid-frame with the same image.

**Fixes applied:**

- **`ProcessBlur`**: Removed `old?.Dispose()`. Ownership of the old `SKImage` is transferred to the `LiveBackgroundCustomDrawOperation` that captured it — the draw op disposes it in its `Dispose()` method which Avalonia calls _after_ rendering is complete. SkiaSharp's `Dispose()` is idempotent, so double-disposal across overlapping frames is safe.
- **`UpdateBlurredBitmap(null)`**: No longer disposes `_blurredImage`. Sets field to `null`; the in-flight draw op cleans up the native memory.
- **`LiveBackgroundCustomDrawOperation.Dispose()`**: Now calls `_image?.Dispose()` — takes explicit ownership of the image lifetime, ensuring native Skia handles are freed after every rendered frame.
- **`LiveBackground.Render()`**: Captures `_blurredImage` to a local variable (`imageSnapshot`) before the null-check, preventing a secondary race where `ProcessBlur` swaps the field between the check and the `context.Custom(...)` constructor call.
- **`OnDetachedFromVisualTree`**: On tree removal (window close), atomically swaps and disposes the current `_blurredImage` — handles the edge case where the source was cleared before any draw op could capture the final image.

**Secondary fix — `OrbitVisualizerCanvas.cs`:**

- **`DrawNeonParticles`**: Added `.ToArray()` snapshot of `_canvas._particles` before iterating, preventing `InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified` if the UI-thread timer modifies the particle list while the render thread is enumerating it (triggered when the MetadataDriven visualizer selects the NeonParticles preset for high-energy tracks).

---

### 🔧 Download Center — Page Load Crash Fixed

The Download Center (Projects page) silently failed to open due to a missing `StaticResource 'EnumToCheckedConverter'` referenced at `DownloadsPage.axaml` line 671 by three batch-profile `ToggleButton` chips. Avalonia threw a `KeyNotFoundException` inside `InitializeComponent()`, which the navigation service caught and swallowed.

**New file:** `Converters/EnumToCheckedConverter.cs` — `IValueConverter` that compares an enum value to a `ConverterParameter` string for `IsChecked`, and parses the parameter back to the enum type on `ConvertBack`.
**App.axaml** — Registered `<conv_root:EnumToCheckedConverter x:Key="EnumToCheckedConverter"/>` in the global resource dictionary.

---

### 🗂️ Side Panel — Tab System & Close Button Fixed

The contextual right-side panel tabs (Player / Inspector / Similar) were non-functional and the close button was wired to a void method (`Sidebar.Close`) which is not bindable as an Avalonia `Command=`.

**`ViewModels/SidebarViewModel.cs`** — Full rewrite:
- Added `SidebarTab` enum (`Player`, `Inspector`, `Similarity`).
- `ActiveTab` property with derived `IsPlayerTab` / `IsInspectorTab` / `IsSimilarityTab` booleans — drive tab highlight and content opacity in AXAML.
- `SwitchToPlayerCommand`, `SwitchToInspectorCommand`, `SwitchToSimilarityCommand` as `ReactiveCommand` — tab buttons are now clickable.
- `CloseCommand` as `ReactiveCommand` — close button now works.
- `PlayerVm` and `SimilarTracksVm` properties injected at construction — the Player and Similarity tabs have proper DataContexts.

**`Views/Avalonia/MainWindow.axaml`** — Close button updated from `Command="{Binding Sidebar.Close}"` to `Command="{Binding Sidebar.CloseCommand}"`.
**`App.axaml.cs`** — Registered `SimilarTracksViewModel` as singleton (required for `SidebarViewModel` DI injection).

---

### ⬇️ Download Engine — Restart After Stop Fixed

Clicking **Stop Engine** followed by **Start Engine** did nothing — the engine appeared to start but never processed items. Root cause: `_globalCts` was `readonly`, so after `StopAsync()` cancelled it, `StartAsync()` reused the already-cancelled token and every `Task.Run` call exited immediately.

**`Services/DownloadManager.cs`:**
- `_globalCts` changed from `private readonly` to `private`.
- `StartAsync()` now disposes and recreates the `CancellationTokenSource` if it was previously cancelled before spawning the processing loop.

### 🔒 Download Center — Sidebar Auto-Close on Navigation

Navigating to the Download Center (Projects page) left the right-side panel open, obscuring the download list header and batch controls.

**`Views/MainViewModel.cs`** — `NavigateToProjects()` now sets `IsGlobalSidebarOpen = false` before navigating, matching the same pattern used by `NavigateToPlayer()`.

## [Unreleased — previous] — 2026-04-09

### 🎛️ Studio Mode — Session Persistence

The Workstation page now saves and restores its state across app launches and unexpected crashes.

**New files:**
- `Models/Stem/WorkstationSession.cs` — JSON-serialisable snapshot: active mode, timeline offset/zoom, per-deck loaded track (file path, hash, title, artist, BPM, key, playback position).
- `Services/WorkstationSessionService.cs` — Atomic save (temp-file swap, never corrupts the last good snapshot on crash) and load. Written to `%APPDATA%\Antigravity\workstation-session.json`.

**WorkstationViewModel changes:**
- Injected `WorkstationSessionService` (registered as DI singleton).
- `RestoreSessionAsync()` — runs on startup; reloads tracks into Deck A/B by file path; cue points and stem preferences re-fetched from SQLite/file automatically via existing services.
- `SaveSessionAsync()` — autosaves on every track load into any deck and on every mode switch (Waveform / Flow / Stems / Export).
- `Dispose()` — synchronous flush so the session is written even when the OS terminates the process after the window closes.
- `OnTrackLoaded` callback on `WorkstationDeckViewModel` (both paths: `LoadTrackCommand` + `LoadPlaylistTrackCommand`) triggers parent autosave.
- `AddDeckCommand` attaches the callback to dynamically-added decks C/D.

### 🗂️ Library — Context Menu & Selection Bar Fixes

All right-click context menu actions in the track DataGrid are now fully functional and consistent.

**Root cause:** In Avalonia, `ContextMenu` renders in a separate popup visual tree so element references like `CommandParameter="{Binding #TrackGrid.SelectedItem}"` always resolve to `null`, silently breaking every command that received the parameter. All five affected items have been fixed.

**Changes:**
- `Views/Avalonia/TrackListView.axaml` — Removed 5 broken `CommandParameter="{Binding #TrackGrid.SelectedItem}"` bindings. Added new **🔬 Analyse Track** menu item (`Operations.AnalyseTrackCommand`). Separator grouping cleaned up.
- `ViewModels/Library/TrackOperationsViewModel.cs`:
  - `ExecutePlayTrack` / `ExecuteHardRetry` / `ExecuteOpenFolder` / `ExecuteRemoveTrack` — fall back to `LibraryViewModel?.Tracks.LeadSelectedTrack` when called with a null parameter (the normal Avalonia context menu case).
  - `ExecuteAddToQueue(null)` — now delegates to `ExecuteAddSelectedToQueue()` rather than silently returning.
  - New `AnalyseTrackCommand` / `ExecuteAnalyseTrack` — publishes `TrackAnalysisRequestedEvent` for the right-clicked track (falls back to lead selection).

**Bottom selection FAB (LibraryPage):** Added **▶️ Play** (`Tracks.Operations.PlayTrackCommand`) and **⊕ Add to Queue** (`Tracks.Operations.AddSelectedToQueueCommand`) buttons — now all selection actions (play, queue, analyse, tag edit, rekordbox export, clear) are accessible without opening the context menu.

---

### 🎵 Queue Panel — Playing Indicator Fix

`Views/Avalonia/QueuePanel.axaml` — The now-playing `▶️` indicator in the queue list was using `ConverterParameter={Binding}`, which is **not valid Avalonia AXAML** (ConverterParameter does not accept binding expressions). The indicator never highlighted the current track.

**Fix:** Replaced with `IsVisible="{Binding $parent[ListBoxItem].IsSelected}"` — works correctly because `SelectedIndex` is already bound to `CurrentQueueIndex`, so the selected list item is always the currently-playing track.

---

### ⚡ Workstation — Phase 2: Full Stem & Flow Builder Implementation

This milestone completes the Workstation page from a ~40 % skeleton to a
fully-wired creative canvas with four functional modes.

#### New ViewModels — Stem Mixer (`ViewModels/Workstation/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `StemChannelViewModel.cs` | Single fader strip (Vocals / Drums / Bass / Other). Delegates `GainDb`, `Pan`, `IsMuted`, `IsSoloed` directly to `StemMixerService`. Exposes `MuteCommand`, `SoloCommand`, `ResetCommand`. |
| `StemMixerViewModel.cs` | Owns the NAudio `StemMixerService` (44 100 Hz stereo). Wires `LoadAndSeparateCommand : ReactiveCommand<string, Unit>` consumed by `WorkstationDeckViewModel`. Manages ONNX separation progress, cancellation, and exposes per-stem WAV paths (`VocalsWavPath`, …). |
| `StemWaveformRowViewModel.cs` | Thin row VM (`WaveformData?`, `Progress`, `IsLoading`) bound to a `WaveformControl` per stem. |
| `StemWaveformViewModel.cs` | Aggregates four `StemWaveformRowViewModel` instances plus `SharedZoomLevel` / `SharedViewOffset`. `LoadStemWaveformsAsync(vocals, drums, bass, other)` runs four parallel inline NAudio extractions — reads PCM floats, bins 1 000-bucket RMS/peak arrays, wraps results in `WaveformAnalysisData`. |
| `CueEditorViewModel.cs` | Manages hot-cue CRUD for a loaded deck track. |
| `ExportDialogViewModel.cs` | Drives the export dialog — output path, format (WAV / MP3 / FLAC), normalisation, dithering, export progress. `SetDecks()` populates from active Workstation decks. |
| `WorkstationDeckViewModel.cs` | Thin wrapper over `DeckSlotViewModel`. **Added `StemWaveforms : StemWaveformViewModel` property**. After separation completes, calls `StemWaveforms.LoadStemWaveformsAsync(…)` to populate the visual waveform strip. |
| `WorkstationViewModel.cs` | Root page VM. **Added `ExportPanel : ExportDialogViewModel` property** — the same instance powers both the inline Export mode panel and the toolbar Export popup, disposed together with the page. |

#### New ViewModels — Flow Builder (`ViewModels/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FlowTrackCardViewModel.cs` | Represents a single track card on the Flow Builder timeline. Exposes `Artist`, `Title`, `BpmDisplay`, `KeyDisplay`, `DurationDisplay`, `EnergyCurvePoints` (RMS-sampled from `WaveformData` bytes, 8 buckets), `HasBridge`, `Bridge : FlowBridgeInfo?`. Contains `SetBridgeTo(next)` which computes Camelot-wheel distance → colour-coded `ScoreBrush` (teal ≤ 1 step, yellow ≤ 2, orange ≤ 4, red ≥ 5) plus BPM-delta display string. Exposes `MoveLeftCommand`, `MoveRightCommand`, `RemoveCommand` (callbacks into parent). Also declares the `FlowBridgeInfo` record (BpmDeltaDisplay, ScoreBrush, KeyLabel, Tooltip). |
| `FlowBuilderViewModel.cs` | Drives the Flow Builder mode. Constructor: `(ILibraryService, PlaylistOptimizer)`. Loads playlists via `LoadPlaylistsCommand` auto-fired on construction. `LoadSelectedPlaylistCommand` fetches up to 500 tracks, calls `PlaylistOptimizer.OptimizeAsync` for AI-ordered BPM+Camelot sequencing (unanalysed tracks appended at end), builds `ObservableCollection<FlowTrackCardViewModel>`, runs `RefreshBridges()`. `SuggestNextCommand` fetches all remaining candidates, calls optimizer with `StartTrackHash = Tracks.Last()` to pick the single best next track. `ClearCommand` clears the set. Transition bridges are recalculated after every structural mutation (move/remove). |

#### WorkstationPage AXAML — Mode Wiring (`Views/Avalonia/WorkstationPage.axaml`)

**Stems mode** — replaced "coming in Epic #144" placeholder with:
- Header bar: deck label, track title, `⚡ Separate Stems` button, live separation progress `%`.
- Two-column body: `StemMixerView` (300 px fixed, dark-bordered left panel) + `StemWaveformView` (fill right).
- Both views bind to `FocusedDeck.Stems` / `FocusedDeck.StemWaveforms` respectively.

**Export mode** — replaced "coming in Epic #143" placeholder with a full inline form bound to `WorkstationViewModel.ExportPanel`:
- Output file path text-box (editable).
- Format combo (WAV / MP3 / FLAC).
- Normalise / Dither checkboxes.
- Scrollable `ProgressBar` + `StatusMessage` (visible only while exporting).
- `Export Mix` button + `Cancel` button (visible only while exporting).

---

### 🖥️ MainWindow Navigation Consolidation (`Views/Avalonia/MainWindow.axaml`)

- **Merged** the three separate sidebar items (Decks, Timeline, Stems) into a single **Workstation** nav button (`NavigateWorkstationCommand`, `PageType.Workstation`).
- Added `Ctrl+Z` → `UndoPlaylistCommand` and `Ctrl+Y` → `RedoPlaylistCommand` global keybindings.
- Added right-panel tab button styles (`Button.tab`, `.tab:pointerover`, `.tab.selected`) for the new right-panel multi-tab header.
- Rewired right-panel header and body to support tabbed inspector layout with tab-selector row.

---

### 🌊 WaveformControl Enhancements (`Views/Avalonia/Controls/WaveformControl.cs`)

- **`FrequencyColorMode : bool` (StyledProperty)** — when `true`, renders using tri-band colour encoding: Low band → hot-pink/red, Mid band → neon-green, High band → cyan/blue. Falls back to synthetic approximation from peak data when no `LowBand` is bound. Registered in `AffectsRender`.
- **Hover cursor tracking** — `_hoverX` field updated on `PointerMoved`, `PointerEntered`, cleared on `PointerExited`. Triggers `InvalidateVisual()` for live time-position indicator rendering.

---

### 🔗 SimilarTracksPanel — Bridge Mode & Batch Add (`Views/Avalonia/SimilarTracksPanel.axaml`)

- **Bridge Mode UI** — alternate header label "Bridge Mode" (teal) shown when `IsBridgeMode` is active.
- **`Add All` button** — adds all current results to a project; visible when `Results.Count > 0`; uses `NumericConverters.IsNotZero`.
- **`bridgeRow` style class** — distinct dark-green tinted row for bridge-compatible suggestions with hover highlight.
- `Button.addBtn` opacity fade-in on `pointerover` for both `row` and `bridgeRow` selectors.
- Layout extended from `RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,*"` to `RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,*,Auto,Auto"` (space for bridge header + bulk-action footer).

---

### 📊 LibraryTrackInspector Upgrade (`Views/Avalonia/Controls/LibraryTrackInspector.axaml`)

- Added **inline WaveformControl strip** (64 px, read-only, bound to `WaveformData` + `Cues`) above the Status section.
- Added **Sonic Profile section** — Energy, Valence, Danceability as labelled `ProgressBar` rows (0–1 range, colour-coded).
- Inspector `DesignHeight` updated 800 → 900 to fit new content.
- `xmlns:controls` namespace added for WaveformControl reference.

---

### 📈 AnalysisPage Queue Metrics (`Views/Avalonia/AnalysisPage.axaml`)

- **Real-time queue telemetry strip** (visible when `HasQueueMetrics`): three labelled stats — `AvgAnalysisTimeDisplay`, `ThroughputDisplay`, `ElapsedTimeDisplay`.
- Track list panel switched to **`VirtualizingStackPanel`** for large-library performance.
- Queue pane header/start-button grid redesigned; analysis queue visual improvements.
