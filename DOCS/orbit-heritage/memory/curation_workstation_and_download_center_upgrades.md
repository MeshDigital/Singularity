This document serves as the canonical record for the design, implementation, and integration of the **ORBIT Structural Curation Workstation** and the subsequent **Download Center Queue & Log Enhancements**.

## 1. Curation Workstation Architecture

We have implemented a producer-grade structural curation system enabling deep audio analysis, phrase snapping, and native Pioneer Rekordbox exports.

### 1.1 Multi-Tier DSP Analysis Pipeline
- **Transient Clustering (`TransientClusteringEngine.cs`)**: Extracts transients from raw mono float audio signals using energy envelopes. Computes 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) over a 1024-sample window around each transient and runs an in-memory K-Means clustering algorithm (K=4) to categorize transients into Kick, Snare, Percussion, and FX.
- **Harmonic Phase Tracking (`HarmonicPhaseTracker.cs`)**: Maps FFT frames to 12 semitones to generate chroma vectors. Runs a cosine similarity comparison across frames to detect modulations and harmonic rhythm resets.
- **Drum Pattern Fingerprinting (`DrumPatternFingerprintEngine.cs`)**: Implements Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) using horizontal (time) and vertical (frequency) median filters. Computes 4-bar percussive envelope signature vectors and flags pattern mismatches.
- **Energy Curve Normalization (`EnergyCurveNormalizer.cs`)**: Normalizes energy curves using 3 tiers: local 32-beat window scaling, global track peak scaling, and genre-profile dynamic balancing (e.g., expanding boundaries for Techno vs. retaining ambient contrasts).
- **Analysis Pipeline (`AnalysisPipeline.cs`)**: Orchestrates the ingestion of audio files (via FFmpeg decoding and `AudioIngestionPipeline`), Mono downmixing, and all core DSP passes.

### 1.2 Snapping & Confidence Matrix
- **Phrase Snapping (`TransientAwareSnappingEngine.cs`)**: Snaps raw time coordinates onto strict 32-beat phrase ledger boundaries derived from the downbeat anchor ($T_0$) and tempo ($\Delta B = 60 / \text{BPM}$):
  $$T_{\text{phrased}} = T_0 + (N_{\text{phrase}} \times 32 \times \Delta B)$$
- **Confidence Matrix (`SnappingConfidenceMatrix.cs`)**: Computes a weighted confidence score based on structural, harmonic, transient, and energy indicators.

### 1.3 Auto-Cue & Intent Classification
- **Intent Classifier (`IntentClassifier.cs`)**: Implements rule-based intent mapping (Intro, Outro, Drops, Breakdowns, and Bridges) using timeline ratios and energy/pattern variations.
- **Cue Point Generator (`CueGenerationService.cs`)**: Populates the 8 standard DJ cues (First Downbeat, Mix-In, First Breakdown, First Drop, Bridge, Second Drop, Mix-Out Warning, Final Beat) while running vocal density collision checks to prevent mid-phrase vocal overlaps.

### 1.4 Database Concurrency & Hygiene
- **WAL Mode (`WalModeInterceptor.cs`)**: Registers a custom connection interceptor that configures Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and synchronous NORMAL mode, eliminating database locks under high P2P write traffic.
- **Library Maintenance (`LibraryMaintenanceService.cs`)**: Implements Pass 1 (deleting orphaned `.part`/`.tmp` file writes older than 12 hours) and Pass 2 (reconciling missing and hung downloads back to `Pending` status).
- **Physical/Virtual Tracking**: Relocated `TrackEntity.cs` to `/Database/Entities/` and extended the schema with tracking fields (`IsLocalFile`, `LocalFilePath`, `Status`, `SpectralForensicsData`, `CommentsPayload`).

### 1.5 Rekordbox Exporter
- **XML Serializer (`RekordboxXmlExporter.cs`, `RekordboxSchemaModels.cs`)**: Translates collections to Pioneer Rekordbox XML v5 format.
- **Double-Loop Mapping**: Loops are serialized to `<POSITION_MARK>` (memory loop active tags) and `<POSITION_MARK Num="0..7">` (hot loops) to ensure hardware CDJ compatibility.
- **Waveform Omission Safeguard**: Omits binary `<WaveForm>` tags to allow Rekordbox to compute waveforms natively on import, preserving file size.
- **Comment Ingestion**: Packs Energy, Mood, and Confidence into the standard `<Comment>` tag.

## 2. Interactive Workstation UI

- **Timeline Canvas (`WorkstationPage.axaml.cs`)**: Renders interactive cue markers on a Skia/Avalonia canvas, supporting drag-and-drop.
- **Workstation ViewModel (`WorkstationViewModel.cs`)**: Coordinates timeline calculations, collections of `CueMarkerViewModel` and `LoopViewModel`, and recalculates analysis weights via Transient Precision and Energy Threshold sliders.

## 3. Download Center & Queue Enhancements

To support bulk operations and track queue diagnostics, the following features were added to the Download Center ViewModels:

### 3.1 Group Queue Cancellation & Safety
- **State Reset Safety**: In `DownloadGroupViewModel.cs`, when a user triggers group cancellation, any track in a transient state (`Downloading`, `Searching`, `Queued`, `Pending`) is set to `TrackStatus.Failed` to halt the P2P orchestrator loop safely.
- **Soft Clearing**: Marks the track view model and database model as soft-cleared (`IsClearedFromDownloadCenter = true`) and persists the change using `_libraryService.UpdatePlaylistTrackAsync` so they are hidden from the active download center lists.
- **Cancel command**: Invokes `_downloadManager.CancelTrack(t.GlobalId)` to release peer handles immediately.

### 3.2 Live Log Engine
- **Event Subscription**: Subscribes to `TrackStateChangedEvent` in `DownloadCenterViewModel.cs`.
- **Log Generation**: Formats events into structured `EngineLogEntry` logs containing timestamps, levels (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `SUCCESS`), stages (`ENGINE`, `SEARCH`, `DOWNLOAD`), and descriptive messages. The logs are displayed in the UI and capped at 1000 items.

### 3.3 Administrative Actions
- **Reset Download Center (`ResetDownloadCenterCommand`)**: Asks for user confirmation, cancels all active/pending track operations, soft-clears all historical downloads in the database, clears the live logs collection, and displays a global status confirmation.
- **Cancel All Active (`CancelAllActiveCommand`)**: Quickly iterates through all active tracks currently in `Searching` or `Downloading` states and cancels them on the `DownloadManager`.

## 4. Integration Hardening & Compilation Fixes (2026-06-16)

Following the relocation of curation workstation elements and the simplification of the Download Center, the codebase was hardened to resolve 16 compilation/semantic errors:
1. **LoopViewModel Escape Sequence**: Fixed `LoopViewModel.cs` where standard TimeSpan string interpolation (`$"{start:mm\\:ss}"`) triggered lexical unrecognized escape sequence errors (CS1009). Remapped to verbatim string interpolation `$@"{start:mm\:ss}"`.
2. **PlaylistTrack Model References**: Corrected `AlbumNode.cs` and `LibraryViewModel.Commands.cs` where the `CancelTrack` call referenced `t.GlobalId` instead of the model's actual `TrackUniqueHash` identifier.
3. **ShowGlobalStatus Parameter Alignment**: Aligned the nuclear reset command in `DownloadCenterViewModel.cs` to pass the required `context` parameter to `ShowGlobalStatus`.
4. **4-Deck Stub Parity**: Added stub properties/methods (`FocusedDeck`, `Decks`, `ExitLoopFocusedCommand`, `SyncBpmCommand`, `IsSnapEnabled`, `KeyboardOverlay`, `ApplySmartSnapForDeckDrop`) to `WorkstationViewModel.cs` to maintain compilation compatibility with legacy 4-deck UI views (`MixerCenter`, `WaveformInspector`, `StemsInspector`, `WorkstationDeckRow`) and the global `KeyboardEventRouter` keyboard shortcut coordinator.
5. **WorkstationDeckRow Page Reference**: Updated `WorkstationDeckRow.axaml.cs` to reference the renamed `CurationWorkstationPage` instead of the legacy `WorkstationPage`.
