## Phase 0: Critical Operational Resilience (Weeks 1-4) 🔴⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

### 0.1 Crash Recovery Journal (8 hours) - NEW ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Power loss or crashes during downloads cause orphaned files, lost state, and duplicate downloads.  
**Solution**: Lightweight transaction log that enables automatic recovery on startup.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `Services/CrashRecoveryService.cs`
- [ ] Add `CrashRecoveryJournal` SQLite table or JSON file
- [ ] Log active downloads with checkpoint data (bytes written, .part file paths, pending operations)
- [ ] Implement startup recovery logic:
  - Detect orphaned `.part` files
  - Resume interrupted downloads from last checkpoint
  - Rollback incomplete metadata writes
  - Clean up corrupted state
- [ ] Integrate with `DownloadManager` to write checkpoints every 5 seconds during active downloads
- [ ] Add `App.axaml.cs` startup hook to call `CrashRecoveryService.RecoverAsync()`

**Journal Schema**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "active_downloads": [
    {
      "track_id": "xyz",
      "state": "downloading",
      "bytes_written": 2457600,
      "part_file": "C:\\temp\\track.mp3.part",
      "last_checkpoint": "2025-12-24T00:10:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pending_metadata_writes": [...]
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents 100% of data loss from crashes. Professional-grade resilience.

**Problem**: Direct file writes can corrupt files during power loss or app crashes.  
**Solution**: Reusable utility that ALL file-writing services use for atomic operations.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `Utils/SafeWrite.cs` with atomic write pattern:
  ```csharp
  public static class SafeWrite
  {
      public static async Task<bool> WriteAtomicAsync(
          string finalPath, 
          Func<string, Task> writeAction,
          Func<string, Task<bool>>? verifyAction = null)
      {
          var tempPath = $"{finalPath}.part";
          // 1. Write to temp file
          // 2. Verify (optional)
          // 3. Atomic rename
      }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Refactor `DownloadManager` to use `SafeWrite.WriteAtomicAsync()`
- [ ] Refactor `MetadataTaggerService` to use SafeWrite for tag writes
- [ ] Refactor `DatabaseService.BackupAsync()` to use SafeWrite

### 0.4 SQLite WAL Mode + Index Audit (2 hours) - ENHANCE EXISTING ⭐⭐ HIGH
**Current**: 6 performance indexes exist (ROADMAP line 29)  
**Enhancement**: Enable Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Update `AppDbContext.cs` or `DatabaseService.cs`:
  ```csharp
  protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder options)
  {
      var connection = new SqliteConnection(connectionString);
      connection.Open();
      
      // Enable WAL mode
      var cmd = connection.CreateCommand();
      cmd.CommandText = "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;";
      cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
      
      options.UseSqlite(connection);
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add `DatabaseService.AuditIndexesAsync()` method to detect missing indexes
- [ ] Run audit on app startup (dev builds only)

**Benefits**: Writers don't block readers, faster commits, better UI responsiveness.

---

### 0.5 Atomic File Operations Pipeline (4 hours) - NEW ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Current "fire-and-forget" download model has no transaction safety.  
**Solution**: Implement `.part` file workflow with verification before final rename.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Update `DownloadManager.ProcessTrackWithFolderLogicAsync()`:
  - Download to `{filename}.part` instead of final name
  - Verify file integrity (size check, format validation)
  - Atomic rename from `.part` to final filename
  - Delete `.part` file on failure
- [ ] Add resume capability:
  - Check for existing `.part` files before starting download
  - Resume from last byte position (if Soulseek protocol supports)
- [ ] Integrate with Crash Recovery Journal for checkpoint tracking

**Impact**: Enables resumable downloads, prevents corruption on crashes/WiFi drops.

---

### 🚨 Technical Debt & Stability (Pending FIX)
- [ ] **N+1 Query Pattern Risk**: Refactor project loading to use eager loading (.Include) for track counts to prevent performance degradation.
- [ ] **Soft Deletes & Audit Trail**: Implement `IsDeleted` and `DeletedAt` for imports to allow recovery and history tracking.
- [ ] **Status Management Standardization**: Create a centralized `StatusConverter` to map DB strings to internal enums consistently.
- [ ] **Intelligent Download Hub (Bento Refactor)**:
  - [ ] Implement `DownloadAnalyticsService` for Global ETA/Speed windowing.
  - [ ] Refactor `DownloadsPage.axaml` with Bento Grid header (Speed, ETA, Storage, Health).
  - [ ] Integrate micro-thumbnails (64px) into `DownloadItemViewModel`.
  - [ ] Add Disk-I/O bottleneck detection warnings.
- [ ] **Real-time Deduplication Sync**: Ensure `PlaylistTrack` and `LibraryEntry` states stay in sync immediately upon download failure/success.
- [ ] **Library Resilience**: Implement automated daily backups of `%appdata%/SLSKDONET/library.db`.
- [ ] **Batch Duplicate Fix**: Update `DownloadManager.QueueProject` to check against `addedInBatch` set during hash check loop.
- [ ] **UI Thread Safety**: Wrap `PlaylistTrackViewModel` property updates (via event bus) in `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post`.
- [ ] **Coordinate Precision**: Refactor `LibraryPage.axaml.cs` drag-drop to use `VisualRoot` / `PointToClient` for transformations.
- [ ] **Selection Robustness**: Replace `Task.Delay` in `LibraryViewModel` with a reactive "Wait until Project exists in collection" logic.
- [ ] **Source of Truth Sync**: Update `TrackListViewModel` to cross-reference `DownloadManager` for active tracks not yet in global index.
- [ ] **Shared Folder Logic**: Implement backend logic in `SoulseekAdapter` to actually share files from the configured Shared Folder (currently UI-only).

### 🎯 Metadata Gravity Well 2.0 - Refinements (SpotiSharp Integration)
**Source**: Deep dive analysis comparing ORBIT implementation with SpotiSharp reference architecture

#### Phase 1: Authentication & Connection (HIGH Priority)
- [x] ~~Implement `GetAuthenticatedClientAsync()` with proper PKCE authentication~~ (COMPLETE - Dec 22, 2025)
- [x] ~~Use `PKCEAuthenticator` for automatic token refresh~~ (COMPLETE - Dec 22, 2025)
- [x] ~~Fix Soulseek race condition: `LoggedIn` vs `Connected` check~~ (COMPLETE - Dec 22, 2025)
- [ ] **Ready Event Pattern**: Implement "Ready" event in `SoulseekAdapter` that `DownloadManager` listens for before popping tracks from queue.

#### Phase 2: Intelligence & Enrichment (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] **SpotifyUriResolver**: Create `Utils/SpotifyUriResolver.cs` with Regex to identify Track/Album/Playlist IDs from various formats.
  - Handle `open.spotify.com/track/...` mobile share links
  - Handle `spotify:track:...` URI strings  
  - Generic "Intake" flexibility for user input
- [ ] **Native Batch Enrichment**: Refactor `SpotifyMetadataService.cs` to use native library for ISRC.
  - Use `client.Tracks.GetSeveral(new TracksRequest(ids))` to capture ISRC field
  - Already using `client.Tracks.GetSeveralAudioFeatures()` for BPM/Key ✅
- [ ] **Smart Duration Gating**: Implement `SearchResultMatcher.cs` fuzzy duration logic.
  - If Spotify says 210s, create "Success Range" of 207-213s
  - Score 1.0 for in-range, 0.0 for outliers (e.g., 8min Extended Mix)
  - Prevents false matches on remixes/radio edits

#### Phase 3: File Integrity & Normalization (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Filename Normalization Service**: Create `Utils/FilenameNormalizer.cs`.
  - Strip illegal OS characters: `\ / : * ? " < > |`
  - Remove redundant "feat." tags from Title if already in Artist field
  - Implement `Cleanup()` method for artist names (SpotiSharp pattern)
- [ ] **FFmpeg Progress Feedback**: Enhance `SonicIntegrityService.cs` with real-time progress.
  - Capture `StandardError` stream during FFmpeg analysis
  - Parse `time=` output to calculate percentage
  - Fire `TrackProgressChangedEvent` for Downloads Page progress bar

#### UX Polish & Reliability (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Downloads Page Hydration**: Fix "Empty Downloads Page" bug.
  - On `DownloadCenterViewModel.Initialize()`, query database for current state:
    ```csharp
    ActiveDownloads = _db.Tracks.Where(t => t.State == Downloading).ToList();
    ```
  - Ensures UI reflects DB state, not just live events
- [ ] **Deterministic Track ID**: Implement hash-based deduplication.
  - Generate `TrackEntity.Id` using hash of ISRC (if available) or `artist-title` lowercase string
  - Prevents duplicate downloads across multiple playlist jobs
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker UI Indicator**: Add `_isSpotifyServiceDegraded` flag.
  - Set flag on 403 errors instead of just breaking loop
  - Bind "Warning Icon" in header to show "Spotify Sync Unavailable" status
  - User feedback instead of silent failures

  - User feedback instead of silent failures

## 🎯 "Biggers App" Search Architecture Refactoring (5-Week Initiative) - NEW STRATEGIC PRIORITY

**Philosophy Shift**: From "Everything gets a score" → "Filter strict trash, then rank by tier"  
**User Control**: From complex sliders → Clear intent-based strategies  
**Goal**: Eliminate false positives, magic numbers, and provide deterministic decision-making

### The Two-Stage Pipeline Architecture

#### Stage 1: The Gatekeeper (Strict Filtering)
- [ ] **Create `Services/SafetyFilterService.cs`** (Week 2)
  - [ ] **Integrity Gate**: Reject fake FLAC/upconverted MP3 (port `SonicIntegrityService` logic)
  - [ ] **Duration Gate**: `Math.Abs(candidate.Length - target.Length) > DurationTolerance` → REJECT
  - [ ] **Strict Token Match**: ALL query tokens must be present in filename (slsk-batchdl method)
  - [ ] **Ban List Gate**: Check `BlacklistedUsers` → REJECT
  - [ ] Unit test with messy filenames and edge cases

- [ ] **Implement `Utils/TokenMatcher.cs`** (Week 2)
  - [ ] Normalize query and filename (lowercase, strip punctuation, remove tags `[320]`, `(Official)`)
  - [ ] Split into token sets
  - [ ] Verify token intersection (ALL query tokens present)
  - [ ] Handle Unicode normalization (dashes, quotes)

#### Stage 2: Tiered Comparer (Ranking)
- [ ] **Create `Services/TieredTrackComparer.cs`** (Week 3)
  - [ ] **Tier 1 - Primary Goal**:
    - `QualityFirst`: `BitrateGap > SignificantBitrateGap` → Pick higher bitrate
    - `DjReady`: Has BPM/Key metadata? → Pick it → Else check quality
  - [ ] **Tier 2 - Reliability & Speed**:
    - Free slot available? → Instant win
    - `QueueGap > SignificantQueueGap` → Pick smaller queue
  - [ ] **Tier 3 - Polish (Tie-Breakers)**:
    - Format preference (FLAC over MP3 if user prefers)
    - Filename aesthetics (cleaner filename wins)

### New Data Structures

- [ ] **Define `Models/SearchPolicy.cs`** (Week 1)
  - [ ] `SearchPriority` enum (`QualityFirst`, `DjReady`)
  - [ ] Boolean modifiers (`PreferSpeedOverQuality`)
  - [ ] Safety gates (`EnforceFileIntegrity`, `EnforceStrictTitleMatch`, `EnforceDurationMatch`)
  - [ ] Thresholds (`DurationToleranceSeconds`, `SignificantBitrateGap`, `SignificantQueueGap`)

- [ ] **Create `Services/ConfigMigration.cs`** (Week 1)
  - [ ] Detect old `ScoringWeights` configuration
  - [ ] Heuristic mapping to `SearchPolicy`:
    - High `MusicalWeight` → `Priority = DjReady`
    - High `AvailabilityWeight` → `PreferSpeedOverQuality = true`
    - Else → `Priority = QualityFirst`
  - [ ] Archive old weights, persist new policy
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### UI Redesign

- [ ] **Delete "Mixing Desk" UI** (Week 4)
  - [ ] Remove `Advanced Ranking & Tuning` section from `SettingsPage.axaml`
  - [ ] Delete sliders for Musical/String/Availability/Quality weights
  - [ ] Remove "Live Preview" scoring points display

- [ ] **Create "Strategy Command" Card** (Week 4)
  - [ ] **Primary Goal Dropdown**:
    - "Audiophile (Quality First)" - Strict bitrate/lossless focus
    - "DJ Mode" - Prioritize BPM/Key metadata
  - [ ] **Behavior Modifiers Section**:
    - "Prefer Speed" toggle with tooltip explaining tolerance widening
  - [ ] **Safety Gates Section** (all default ON):
    - "Strict Name Matching" - Only download files with all query words
    - "Verify Integrity" - Reject fake/upscaled files
    - "Verify Duration" - Reject remixes/edits with different lengths

### Integration & Refactoring

- [ ] **Refactor `Services/SearchOrchestrationService.cs`** (Week 4)
  - [ ] Insert `SafetyFilterService.Filter()` before ranking
  - [ ] Replace `ResultSorter` with `TieredTrackComparer`
  - [ ] Remove all `SortingCriteria` and weight-based code
  - [ ] Update call sites to use new pipeline

- [ ] **Update `Configuration/AppConfig.cs`** (Week 1)
  - [ ] Add `SearchPolicy` property
  - [ ] Deprecate `ScoringWeights` (keep for migration)
  - [ ] Update serialization logic

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Side-by-Side Comparison Tests** (Week 5)
  - [ ] Test case: "Strobe - Deadmau5" (compare old vs new results)
  - [ ] Test case: "Contact - Daft Punk" (verify token matching)
  - [ ] Test case: Fake FLAC detection (ensure instant rejection)
  - [ ] Test case: Extended Mix vs Radio Edit (duration filter)

- [ ] **Migration Testing** (Week 5)
  - [ ] Verify settings don't get lost during migration
  - [ ] Test heuristic mapping accuracy with sample configs
  - [ ] Ensure UI reflects migrated policy correctly

### Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Foundation
  - Define `SearchPolicy` class and enums
  - Create `ConfigMigration` service
  - Update `AppConfig` schema

- **Week 2**: The Gatekeeper
  - Implement `SafetyFilterService`
  - Port `SonicIntegrityService` into synchronous filter
  - Implement `TokenMatcher` with unit tests

  - Implement `DownloadAutomationService` (auto-queue vs review)

- **Week 5**: Testing & QA
  - Side-by-side testing
  - Migration validation
  - User acceptance testing

**Expected Impact**:
- ✅ Eliminates false positives from fake/upscaled files
- ✅ Provides transparent, deterministic decision-making
- ✅ Replaces magic numbers with clear user intent
- ✅ Reduces configuration complexity (2 dropdowns vs 8 sliders)
- ✅ Improves download success rate by 30-40% (based on user feedback)

---

### 🎯 UI Placeholder Refactor (The "Transparency" Phase) - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
**Goal**: Eliminate "dead clicks" and connect backend logic to frontend placeholders.

#### 1. Track Inspector "Phantom" Data
- [ ] Update `TrackInspectorView` to hide empty "Energy/Danceability" fields if data missing.
- [ ] Add "Fetch Intelligence" button if fields are empty.

- [x] Set `IsEnabled="False"` on "Upgrade Scout" and "Sonic Integrity" (Placeholder UI Hardening).
- [ ] Disable Pitch Slider until `AudioPlayerService` supports stretching.
- [ ] **Rekordbox Stubbing**: Background task to pre-calculate XML structure for Gold Status tracks.
- [ ] Implement "Export to Rekordbox" UI (currently missing) before disabling it.

### 🏗️ Architectural Improvements & Advanced Features

#### Download Stability (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] **Stalled Download Fix**: Improve `SoulseekAdapter.cs` timeout logic.
  - Distinguish between `TransferStates.Queued` and `InProgress`
  - Disable 60-second timeout while `Queued` (can last hours on Soulseek)
  - Only start stall timer once state shifts to `InProgress`
  - Prevents premature download cancellation

#### Intelligence & Scoring (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Uploader Trust Scoring**: Add `QueueLength` and `HasFreeUploadSlot` to `ScoringWeights.cs`.
  - Rank 256kbps with open slot higher than 320kbps with 50-person queue
  - Optimize for "Time-to-Listen" vs absolute fidelity
  - Captures data already available in `ParseTrackFromFile()`
- [ ] **VBR Fraud Detection**: Extend `SonicIntegrityService` to detect upscaled files.
  - Check frequency cutoff (< 16kHz indicates upscaled 128kbps→FLAC)
  - Add `FidelityStatus` field: `Genuine | Upscaled | Suspicious`
  - Visual indicator in UI for low-quality masquerading files
- [ ] **Metadata Confidence Score**: Store `ConfidenceScore` (0.0-1.0) in `TrackEntity`.
  - Used as tie-breaker for Gold Status logic (e.g. 124.01 vs 124.0 BPM).
- [ ] **The Brain 2.0: Adaptive Intelligence**:
  - [ ] **Fuzzy Normalization**: Refactor `CalculateSimilarity` to handle Unicode dashes, curly quotes, and "feat." vs "ft." normalization.
  - [ ] **Relaxation Strategy**: Implement a "Match Relaxation" timer in `DownloadManager`. If no match found after 30s, retry with ±15s tolerance and lower bitrate threshold.
  - [ ] **User Trust & Availability**: Factor in `QueueLength` vs `Bitrate` trade-offs (Aggressive "interference" fix).
  - [ ] **BPM Intelligence**: Add `DjMode` toggle that forces search for "BPM" keywords in filename.
  - [ ] **Quality Hard-Gating**: Default ranking to "High Fidelty" (FLAC Preferred, 320kbps MP3 Floor).

#### Library UI & UX (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] **Draggable Column Reordering**: Implement drag-to-reorder for TreeDataGrid columns.
  - Allow users to prioritize Status, BPM, or other columns first
  - Persist column order to user preferences
  - Improve visual hierarchy and customization
- [ ] **Scoped Album Card ViewModels**: Refactor Bento Grid for performance.
  - Each `AlbumCard` gets its own scoped ViewModel
  - Handles own `DownloadCommand` instead of binding to central command
  - Prevents UI lag with 100+ albums updating simultaneously
- [ ] **Skeleton Screens**: Add loading placeholders during API/search latency.
  - Semi-transparent "ghost rows" during Spotify/Soulseek searches
  - Makes app feel 2x faster with perceived performance boost

#### Advanced Features (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Self-Healing Upgrade Scout**: Background worker to find better quality versions.
  - Scans library for tracks < 192kbps
  - Automatically initiates Soulseek search for 320kbps/FLAC upgrade
  - User approval required before replacing files

## Phase 2.5: Download Orchestration & Active Management (10-12 hours) 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal**: Transform download system from "Import → Fire-and-Forget" to "Active Orchestration" with concurrency control, resumability, and real-time visibility.

### 2.5.1 Orchestration Engine: Throttling & Queuing (3 hours)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**What to Build**:
- [ ] `SemaphoreSlim(4, 4)` throttling in `DownloadManager` to limit concurrent downloads to 4
- [ ] `ProcessQueueLoop` with fire-and-forget pattern for continuous queue processing
- [ ] Folder creation logic: `DefaultLibraryPath/ArtistName/AlbumName/` before first track starts
- [ ] `.part` file handling for resumable downloads (download to `.tmp` → rename on completion)
- [ ] File size verification for resume support (check existing `.part` file size)

**Concurrency Strategy**:
```csharp
private readonly SemaphoreSlim _downloadSemaphore = new(4, 4);

public async Task ProcessQueueLoop(CancellationToken ct)
{
    while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        // 1. Wait for a track to be available in the ConcurrentQueue
        if (_downloadQueue.TryDequeue(out var ctx))
        {
            // 2. Wait for one of the 4 slots to open up
            await _downloadSemaphore.WaitAsync(ct);

            // 3. Fire and forget the download task so the loop can pick up the next track
            _ = Task.Run(async () => 
            {
                try 
                {
                    await ProcessTrackWithFolderLogicAsync(ctx);
                }
                finally 
                {
                    _downloadSemaphore.Release(); // Free up the slot for the next track
                }
            }, ct);
        }
        else
        {
            await Task.Delay(500, ct); // Idle wait

- [ ] Hash verification for partial files (optional: skip if protocol doesn't support)
- [ ] Atomic rename on completion: `TrackName.mp3.part` → `TrackName.mp3`
- [ ] Database state: persist `Paused` state to DB on app close
- [ ] Auto-resume: on app restart, scan DB for `Paused`/`Pending` tracks and re-enqueue

**Resumability Logic**:
```csharp
private async Task DownloadFileAsync(PlaylistTrack track, string targetPath)
{
    var partPath = targetPath + ".part";
    long startPosition = 0;
    
    // Check if partial file exists
    if (File.Exists(partPath))
    {
        var fileInfo = new FileInfo(partPath);
        startPosition = fileInfo.Length;
        _logger.LogInformation($"Resuming download from byte {startPosition}");
    }
    
    // Download with resume support
    // (Implementation depends on Soulseek API support for partial transfers)
    await DownloadFromPositionAsync(track, partPath, startPosition);
    
    // Atomic rename on success
    File.Move(partPath, targetPath, overwrite: false);
}
```

## 🚫 Deferred Features (Post-v1.0 Stabilization)

> [!CAUTION]
> **8-Week Feature Freeze**: The following features are valuable but DEFERRED until after v1.0 stabilization is complete. Focus on reliability and speed first.

### Deferred UX Enhancements
- **Draggable Column Reordering** (TODO line 278-281) - User customization, but not critical
- **Download Timeline Visualization** - Nice-to-have transparency feature
- **Scoring Sandbox** (Dev Tool) - Power user feature, low priority

### Deferred Search Features
- **Advanced Filtering HUD** - Bitrate sliders, format chips, user trust toggle
- **Batch Actions & Selection** - Multi-select download/add to playlist
- **Overlay Bug Fix** - Non-blocking if no user reports

### Deferred Advanced Features
- **Self-Healing Upgrade Scout UI** - Backend exists, defer UI polish
- **DJ-Focused Visuals** - Camelot wheel, waveform preview
- **Rekordbox/Denon USB Export** - Workflow integration, not core functionality

**Rationale**: These features require significant development time but don't impact core reliability. Early adopters must experience a bug-free, fast app before we add complexity.

**Re-evaluation Date**: After 8-week stabilization period (February 2026)

# 🧬 PHASE 17: THE EDM SCIENTIST

> *"From Generic Music Analysis to Genre-Aware Intelligence"*
> 
> January 9, 2026 - A pivotal discovery session

---

## 📖 The Story

### Where We Were: The Blind Approach

Before today, our analysis pipeline was **genre-agnostic**. We used a handful of Essentia models:

- `discogs-effnet` - 519-class general genre classification
- `voice_instrumental` - Vocal detection
- `danceability` - Single danceability score
- 6 individual `mood_*` models - Happy, Sad, Aggressive, etc. (slow, redundant)

**The Problem**: This approach treated DnB the same as Jazz. It couldn't:
- Distinguish between House and Techno (both are "Electronic")
- Identify DJ Tools vs. full tracks
- Provide meaningful emotional mapping for dance music

### The Discovery: EDM Specialist Models

We analyzed our model inventory and discovered **hidden gems**:

```
Tools/Essentia/models/
├── genre_electronic-musicnn-msd-2.pb   <-- EDM SPECIALIST (DnB/House/Techno/Trance/Ambient)
├── tonal_atonal-musicnn-msd-2.pb       <-- DJ TOOL DETECTOR
├── emomusic-msd-musicnn-2.pb           <-- Better than 6 mood models
└── 38 other models...
```

### The Upgrade: Arousal/Valence 2D Vibe Map

Instead of discrete labels ("Happy", "Sad"), we now use **Russell's Circumplex Model**:

```
                    HIGH AROUSAL (9)
                         ↑
              ┌─────────────────────────┐
              │ Dark     │   Festival   │
              │ (Techno) │   (Mainstage)│
              │          │              │
LOW VALENCE ←─┼──────────┼──────────────┼→ HIGH VALENCE
    (1)       │          │              │      (9)
              │Melancholic│    Chill    │
              │(Downtempo)│  (Sunset)   │
              └─────────────────────────┘
                         ↓
                    LOW AROUSAL (1)
```

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated `profile.yaml`

```yaml
highlevel:
    compute: true
    tensorflow_models:
        # CORE BASICS
        - "models/discogs-effnet-bs64-1.pb"
        - "models/voice_instrumental-msd-musicnn-1.pb"
        - "models/danceability-msd-musicnn-1.pb"
        
        # EDM SPECIALISTS (NEW)
        - "models/genre_electronic-musicnn-msd-2.pb"
        - "models/tonal_atonal-musicnn-msd-1.pb"
        - "models/arousal_valence-muse-musicnn-msd-1.pb"  # Missing - needs download
```

### 2. New `AudioFeaturesEntity` Properties

| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Arousal`                      | float (1-9) | arousal_valence  | Energy/Intensity axis          |
| `Valence`                      | float (1-9) | arousal_valence  | Emotional tone axis            |
| `ElectronicSubgenre`           | string      | genre_electronic | "DnB", "House", "Techno", etc. |
| `ElectronicSubgenreConfidence` | float       | genre_electronic | Confidence score               |
| `IsDjTool`                     | bool        | tonal_atonal     | True if Atonal > 0.8           |
| `TonalProbability`             | float       | tonal_atonal     | Melodic content score          |

### 3. Updated `EssentiaAnalyzerService.cs`

New helper methods parse the model outputs:

- `ExtractElectronicSubgenre()` - Picks highest confidence genre
- `ExtractTonalAtonal()` - Returns tonal/atonal probabilities
- `ExtractArousalValence()` - Returns 2D coordinates
- `MapArousalValenceToMood()` - Maps quadrant to label (Festival/Dark/Chill/Melancholic)

## 🧠 Musical Brain 2026: Mission Control & Scalability

**Goal**: Transform the analysis system into a world-class, fluid Pro-DJ command center that handles 100k+ tracks with DAW-level visual fidelity.

### Phase 25: Mission Control Modernization
- [ ] **Forensic Monitor**: "Human-in-the-loop" UI to explain AI rankings and allow manual score overrides for low-confidence detections.
- [ ] **Glass Engine Dashboard**: Visual "Vibe Clusters" showing real-time batch progress with glowing 60fps animations (Avalonia Composition API).
- [ ] **Semantic Theming**: Dynamic row colors based on AI Confidence Scores (High Confidence = Green, Review Needed = Amber).
- [ ] **Command Bar (K-Style)**: `Ctrl+K` palette for operations like "Analyze last import", "Clear failed", or "Boost priority: Bass House".
- [ ] **Sonic Health Gauge**: UI widget showing % of library with High-Fidelity vs. Low-Fidelity metadata/integrity status.

### Phase 26: Cloud-Scale Performance (100k+ Tracks)
- [ ] **Virtualization 2.0**: Shimmer loading, asynchronous prefetching, and delta-updates to ensure fluid scrolling in massive libraries.
- [ ] **Headless Worker**: Decouple `AnalysisQueueService` into a background process that survives main UI crashes.
- [ ] **Batch Refiner**: Bulk correction UI to "re-bias" AI scores for hundreds of tracks simultaneously.

### Phase 27: Forensic Safety & Feedback
- [ ] **Forensic Lockdown**: UI "Safe Mode" that auto-throttles heavy AI tasks if CPU load from the Audio Player/ASIO is too high.
- [ ] **Spectrogram Comparison**: Forensic view to deep-dive into AI detection logic vs. raw spectral signal.
- [ ] **Haptic/Audio Feedback**: Subtle auditory cues when large analysis batches complete.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **MAEST ≠ Maersk**: The "Maersk" model is actually MAEST (Music Audio Efficient Spectrogram Transformer) - a heavy Transformer model, not a shipping company.

2. **Specialist > Generalist**: `genre_electronic` is better for EDM than `discogs-effnet` because it's trained only on electronic music.

3. **Continuous > Discrete**: `arousal_valence` (1 model) replaces 6 `mood_*` models and provides richer data.

4. **Tonal/Atonal = DJ Tool Detection**: A brilliant hack - if a track is >80% atonal, it's likely a drum loop or DJ tool.
