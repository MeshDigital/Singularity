# ORBIT

ORBIT is a music library and DJ prep tool. It finds tracks on Soulseek, checks that what it downloads is actually the right file at the quality it claims to be (real FFT-based fake-lossless detection, not a heuristic), and analyzes everything it collects (BPM, key, energy, phrase structure, cue points, genre/mood via an in-process ONNX classifier) so you can build sets without needing Mixed In Key or a separate prep step in Rekordbox.

Think of it as: search + downloads + a music library + a lightweight DJ workstation, in one app.

> **Before you use it:** ORBIT connects to the Soulseek P2P network, where your IP address is visible to other peers. Like any real Soulseek client, it also shares files back to the network — anyone can browse and download from your configured shared folder. Use a VPN if that matters to you, and only download or share what you're legally allowed to.

## What it actually does

- **Search & download** — searches Soulseek, filters out fake/mislabeled files (wrong bitrate, wrong duration, upscaled lossy-to-"lossless" fakes) before they ever hit your library, and shows you *why* a result was rejected instead of just hiding it.
- **A real library** — playlists organized into folders, ratings, duplicate detection, drag-and-drop between playlists, sortable columns.
- **Playback** — gapless/crossfade transitions between tracks, pitch control.
- **DJ prep (Workstation)** — waveform view, hot cues, loops, energy/phrase analysis, harmonic (Camelot key) matching for finding compatible tracks, and export to Rekordbox XML.
- **Smart playlists** — build playlists from BPM/energy/mood criteria, or ask it to find tracks similar to one you already have.
- **Social** — every peer you've downloaded from becomes a contact: see their shared library, online status, and download history, and chat with them 1:1 or in public rooms (images supported). A notification center keeps you posted on new messages and finished downloads.
- **Playlist sync** — re-check an imported Spotify (or other) playlist for newly added tracks and queue just the new ones, without re-downloading what you already have.

It's under active development, so expect some rough edges — but the core loop (search → download → verify → play/prep) works end to end.

## Getting started

You'll need [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your PATH.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeshDigital/Orbit-pure.git
cd Orbit-pure
dotnet restore
dotnet build SLSKDONET.sln -c Debug
dotnet run
```

On first launch, add your Soulseek account details in Settings.

Optional: the Settings page can install an additional AI phrase-detection engine for cue placement. It's off by default and only installs anything (Conda, plus its own environment) after you explicitly confirm.

## Built with

- **.NET 9 / C#**, UI in **Avalonia**
- **SQLite** (via EF Core) for the local library
- **Soulseek.NET** for the P2P network connection
- **FFmpeg / NAudio** for audio playback and analysis

---

## Project layout

- `Views/Avalonia` — the UI (pages, controls)
- `ViewModels` — screen logic
- `Services` — search, downloads, library, analysis, and everything else behind the scenes
- `Data`, `Migrations` — the local database
- `Tests` — the test suite
- `DOCS/` — deeper technical write-ups, for anyone poking around the internals

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially anything that makes search results more trustworthy, downloads more reliable, or the UI less cluttered. Try to keep changes focused and tested.
