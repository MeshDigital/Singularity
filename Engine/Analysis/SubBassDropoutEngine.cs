/// Isolates the true sub-bass band (30–100 Hz, a bandpass) and detects sub-bass dropouts/returns —
/// the primary DnB drop signature.
///
/// Why this matters for DnB and EDM:
///   The most reliable drop signature in DnB is a "bass dropout" — the sub-bass
///   disappears for 8–32 bars (the breakdown) then returns with extreme energy
///   at the drop. This pattern is acoustically more stable than spectral flux peaks
///   because it persists even when producers layer melodic content over the breakdown.
///
/// Previously this used a single low-pass at 120 Hz, which lumps true sub-bass together with
/// kick fundamental/punch (roughly 90-250 Hz) — content that often stays present through a DnB
/// breakdown even when the sub-bass genuinely drops out, diluting the very signal this engine
/// depends on. A proper bandpass (high-pass 30 Hz to reject DC/rumble, low-pass 100 Hz to
/// substantially exclude kick punch) isolates the sub shelf much more cleanly.
///
/// Signal pipeline:
///   Raw PCM → 30-100 Hz bandpass (NAudio.Dsp.BiQuadFilter, cascaded HP+LP) → RMS energy per
///   window → detect sustained low regions (dropout) → detect return spike
