/// <summary>
/// Probes every completed download for its real audio duration and persists it.
///
/// Duration was, in practice, the least reliable piece of basic track metadata: Bitrate and
/// Format get set from the Soulseek search result and the filename the moment a download starts
/// (DownloadManager.DownloadFileAsync), but nothing ever probed the actual downloaded file for
/// its real duration afterward — a direct DB check found ~70% of library tracks with a real file
/// on disk had a NULL/zero duration, versus <10% for bitrate and ~0% for format. TagLib-based
/// duration extraction already existed, but only on the manual folder-scan import path
/// (LibraryFolderScannerService.CreateLibraryEntry), which most tracks — downloaded via Soulseek,
/// not imported from a folder — never go through.
///
/// Deliberately NOT built as an extension of PostDownloadSpectralScanService: that service is
/// gated behind AppConfig.EnableVbrFraudDetection and only scans lossless formats, neither of
/// which is appropriate for basic duration capture, which should apply unconditionally to every
/// format. Runs unconditionally, format-agnostic, and skips files that already have a duration.
