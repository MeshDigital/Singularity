    // track (true tempo ~160-182) and reports ~78-91 instead. That range sits comfortably inside
    // [MinReasonableBpm, MaxReasonableBpm] above, so the simple range clamp never catches it.
    //
    // The original design for this looked for bimodal BPM-histogram energy at ~2x the chosen
    // candidate as corroborating evidence. Validated against real essentia_streaming_extractor_music
    // output on confirmed half-time-misdetected DnB tracks, that signal never actually appears —
    // this build's beat tracker fully commits to one octave internally and the histogram carries
    // no residual trace of the rejected candidate. Onset rate is the one signal that reliably
    // discriminated a real breakbeat misdetection (~4.4-4.6/sec on confirmed DnB tracks) from
    // the normalisation path leaving genuinely-in-range tempos alone, so it's the sole trigger here.
    //
    // Known open risk: a genuinely slow, percussion-dense track natively in this BPM range (e.g.
    // half-time dubstep/trap authored at ~70-90 BPM) could also clear this onset-rate threshold
    // and get wrongly doubled. There was no such track available to validate against this pass —

    // on non-breakbeat genres and retune OnsetRateCorroborationThreshold if that turns up.
